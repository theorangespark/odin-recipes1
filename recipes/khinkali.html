    <p>Khinkali is quintessential Georgian cuisine, and for good reason, for few can resist these plump dumplings made 
        from thinly rolled dough and stuffed with tender minced meat cooked in its own juice. A variation of this dish called 
        "kalakuri" was created when khinkali - originally a mountain village dish - arrived to the lowland cities ("kalakuri" means "city" 
        in Georgian). It was in the cities that chopped greens began to be added to the minced meat of traditional Georgian khinkali. 
        These greens are now the main feature of kalakuri khinkali which, thanks to this seemingly insignificant addition, acquired a spicy 
        aroma that complements the flavor of meat with notes of light summer freshness.</p>
