    <p>Chakapuli is a Georgian spring dish made from veal or lamb and many fresh herbs, 
        onions, hot peppers and garlic. It is particularly noted for its soft, delicate texture and 
        its bright notes of tarragon, which is added to the dish in small quantities. To make chakapuli, the ingredients are laid 
        out in a heated pot in layers of meat, chopped greens and chopped onions which are alternated several times. During the stewing 
        process, wine and tkemali, a green sauce made from a local plum variety, are added to the pot. When the dish is almost 
        ready, finely chopped garlic is added to the mix. Chakapuli is served with homemade Georgian wine and freshly baked bread.</p>
