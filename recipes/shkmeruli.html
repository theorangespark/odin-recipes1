    <p>A dish called shkmeruli first appeared in the village of Shkmeri in western Georgiaâ€™s 
        Racha Region. According to legend, a local ruler ordered the court chef to quickly concoct a new dish, 
        so he assembled a meal from the everyday products he had on hand: chicken, milk, garlic and spices. It turned 
        out that these ingredients perfectly complemented each other, and shkmeruli has been a popular Georgian meat dishes ever since.</p>
    <p>To make shkmeruli, the chicken is fried and cut into large pieces. A milk-garlic sauce is prepared separately and 
        seasoned with aromatic coriander, a spice called utskho-suneli and Svan salt. The chicken is served in the milk sauce, with a little 
        adjika dip and butter sometimes added for extra flavor. When serving shkmeruli, fresh vegetables, herbs and hot bread are also 
        placed on the side.</p>
