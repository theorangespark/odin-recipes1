        <p>Georgia is a country worth visiting for its food alone, for each Georgian dish is an edible journey into the culture and history of 
            an ancient people. The rich diversity of Georgian national cuisine can be attributed to centuries of isolation of its mountain peoples,
             who over time developed wholly unique culinary traditions. By appreciating each nuanced flavor or participating in a boisterous Georgian
              feast, visitors can experience the essence of Georgian culture and hospitality.</p>
        
        <p>To whet your appetite, we present to you the top 3 Georgian dishes you have to try while in country!</p>
